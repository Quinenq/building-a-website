# Building a website

I'm not a programmer and I don't know anything about IT. But I plan to make a website with the following requirements:

- Profile for users
- Main page of the site
- place to host
- a domain name (suggestion)
- payment system


Note:
These above topic are not necessarily requirements, but problems that need to be resolved.
I don't know the technical terms, but I hope you understand.



## What is this website about?

The idea is to display images of popular, famous, influential people, that is, people with notoriety.
There is an illustration of each of these people. The illustration is divided into 1000 parts,
what I call "space". Users can buy these spaces.
It would work similar to a token market.



## What does the user do with a space?

In one space, the user makes a positive or negative review to that
people. He must justify the criticism. The review is not interpreted positively or
negatively, but marked as being bad or good about the person. This means
that there is a button to choose whether the review is positive (good) or negative (bad) about the person.


## How much does a space cost?

I don't know yet, but it will cost little. I would say between 5 and 10 dollars.


## Why pay for space?

The central idea is precisely to know how much a critique is worth.
How much would someone pay to make a claim about that person.


## Is the website just that?

No, this is the first part of everything I plan to do.
Once the site is up and running, I plan to implement other ideas.

## Lastly:

I need help from everyone who can and wants to participate in this project.

It would help if you share yourself with others.
